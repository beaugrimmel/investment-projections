# investment-projections

This application gathers account values and investment data from my personal budgeting app (YNAB). It then creates monte carlo simulations for investment growth and hypothetical retirment withdrawals. It also genearates a pdf report dislaying the analyis.
 
 Edit secrets.py before using. Alternatively, skip the YNAB import and manually enter account info in simulations.py
